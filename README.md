**1. Project Overview**
The e-GENZURA Medical Monitoring System is a digital patient-flow management solution designed for hospitals and clinics.
Its primary purpose is to track, guide, and optimize patient movement across different service rooms,
ensuring that no patient gets lost, skipped, or delayed during their hospital visit.
By integrating real-time monitoring, queue management, and staff updates, the system reduces congestion,
improves patient satisfaction, and provides hospitals with actionable data for performance analysis.

**2. Problem statement**
Hospitals often face challenges such as:
- Patients getting confused about where to go next.
- Long waiting times and overcrowded service rooms.
- Lack of visibility into patient flow for administrators.
- Difficulty in balancing workloads across departments

**3. Key Objectives**
- Improving patient flow and reduce crowding.
- Providing real-time guidance to patients.
- Enabling staff to monitor patient queues efficiently.
